# Using Dave's Redistricting App

[Daves Redistricting App](http://davesredistricting.org) is an older, full featured and well regarded redistricting map tool. It saves maps in the following CSV format:

>``Id,District``  
``2207116-9,1``  
``220712-7,1``  
``220713-15,1``  
``220714-15,1``  
``2207115-18D,1``  
``220513-K,1``  
``2205116-K,1``  
``2205113-KA,1``

The Louisiana state FIPS code is ``22``, the Parish FIPS codes for Orleans and Jefferson Parishes are ``71`` and ``51`` respectively. Parish level formats are then appended like the Orleans ``11-1A`` and a Jefferson ``111A``, ``11-X`` or ``11-XA`` formats. Water is listed as ``ZZZZZZ``.
