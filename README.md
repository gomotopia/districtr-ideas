# districtr-ideas

Districtr-Ideas is a repository of my ideas on how to use Python to programatically generate JSON files for use in [MGGG](https://github.com/mggg)'s [districtr](https://districtr.org/) app. MGGG's districtr app is an interactive mapping browser application that allows the public to select and draw political voting precincts and ties those boundaries with extensive, historical demographic and electoral data.

Given my experience working with local campaigns, I wanted to use their power tool with extant local political boundaries, to describe to my neighbors how their local boundaries are currently cut and the impact of future decisions. 

Unfortunately, for now, these ideas are set for the state-wide Louisiana juristictions. This is ideal for Congressional, State Legislative, Public Service Commission and Judicial districts. Since my aim, however, concerns local parish or city-wide districts, I'll have to find a way to set the statistics to cover these smaller juristictions.
